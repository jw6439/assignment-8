      <h2 class="title">Climate Change:</h2>
      <!-- p -->
      <p>Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an
        extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years).
      </p>
      <p>Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around
        longer-term average conditions (i.e., more or fewer extreme weather events).</p>

      <p>Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth,
        plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions.</p>

      <p>Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often
        referred to as global warming. </p>

      <p>
        In 1966, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) proposed the term "climatic change" to encompass all forms
        of climatic variability on time-scales longer than 10 years, regardless of cause.
      </p>

      <p>Change was a given and climatic was used as an adjective to describe this kind of change (as opposed to
        political or economic change).</p>

      <p>
        When it was realized that human activities had a potential to drastically alter the climate, the term climate
        change replaced climatic change as the dominant term to reflect an anthropogenic cause.
      </p>

      <p> Climate change was incorporated in the title of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the
        UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p>

      <p>Climate change, used as a noun, became an issue rather than the technical description of changing weather.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Cause: </h2>
      <p>
        Factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or "forcing mechanisms"
        Forcing mechanisms can be either "internal" or "external".
